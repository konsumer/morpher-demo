# morpher-demo

This is a simple react-based demo for buiding  project with dependencies, that includes [morpher-js](https://github.com/jembezmamy/morpher-js). I'm also using this project to work on a react component for it. You can see it in action [here](http://konsumer.github.com/morpher-demo/).

*  `npm start` - Run a local development server
*  `npm run build` - Build minified static site, manually
*  `npm run deploy` - Deploy static site to gh-pages
